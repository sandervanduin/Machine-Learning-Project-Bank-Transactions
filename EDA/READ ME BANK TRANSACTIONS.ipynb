    "## 5. Reflection\n",
    "Reflecting on this project, it's been a truly enlightening team effort. We learned the critical importance of grasping the foundational principles behind machine learning and testing. Before we could confidently use all the methods to our research questions, we needed to thoroughly understand which models were appropriate under which conditions, ensuring that our choices were not just correct, but also relevant to our specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a custom tool for number crunching turned out to be a pivotal element in our project. This tool greatly simplified our analysis of the data, which was quite extensive, and it significantly enhanced our collective understanding of the intricate relationships within our dataset. The development process was challenging, but it was a lesson to our collective commitment to precision and our analytical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges we faced as a team was the volume of data. It was an ambitious endeavor that, in retrospect, could have been approached more efficiently. In future projects, we'll consider using a smaller subset of the data—perhaps 10%—from the start. This would likely save us time and computational resources while still providing an accurate picture for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hurdle we encountered was a learning opportunity for us as a team. There were moments when managing such a large dataset felt daunting. However, each challenge pushed us to think more creatively and to refine our methods for the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting on this project, we've truly come to appreciate the complexities and intricacies of machine learning and statistical testing. As a team, we learned the critical importance of understanding the foundational principles of these methodologies. Before applying various models to our research questions, we immersed ourselves in comprehending which approaches were most appropriate for our specific data. This wasn't just about correctness but relevance and suitability to the unique characteristics of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a custom tool for data analysis turned out to be a key milestone in our project. This tool significantly streamlined our analysis, which was crucial given the extensive nature of our data. More than just a technical achievement, this development process was a testament to our collective commitment to precision and a reflection of our growing analytical capabilities."
